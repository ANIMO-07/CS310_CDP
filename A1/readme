Assignment 1:
1) Write a program that takes an input file, sorts it and writes it to a specified output file.

Given to you:
generate.c
sort.h

After running generate, you will have a file that needs to be sorted. It will be filled with binary data, of the following form: a series of 100-byte records, the first four bytes of which are an unsigned integer key, and the remaining 96 bytes of which are integers that form the rest of the record. 

A) You need to write: sort.c that takes the above file as input and sorts it based on the 4-byte key. The value part should be kept with the same key. The sorted output should be written to a file. For sorting use the library routine qsort.

gcc -o generate generate.c -Wall -Werror

Note: you will also need the header file sort.h to compile this program.

To run it:

./generate -s 0 -n 100 -o /tmp/outfile

There are three flags to generate. The -s flag specified a random number seed; this allows you to generate different files to test your sort on. The -n flag determines how many records to write to the output file, each of size 100 bytes. Finally, the -o flag determines the output file, which will be the input file for your sort.

B) Verify that the file is indeed sorted. 
Write in human readable forms the key that is generated for each record while demonstrating to TA.


2) Find out what is your ip-address using ifconfig. Repeat the same exercise by using whatismyip.com. Do you see any difference? If yes, explain.


3) Write down the latencies for each case
ping 127.0.0.1
ping www.google.com
ping www.iitmandi.ac.in


4) what is the relative ordering among the latencies? Why? 

5) In one terminal, use wget to download a large file and in another, run the ping command. What latencies do you observe?

6) Install wireshark and oracle vmbox on your system. Install an OS image. After successfully installing it, just report saying installation done successfully as your response to this question.
